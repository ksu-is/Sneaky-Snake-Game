The goal of this project is to take a configured Snake game that was quite flashy and hard on the eyes and make it more like the classic
In addition to toning down the colors, the purpose of the edits will be to be able to play the game in secrecy 
so that you can play it on the computer without being caught by your teacher or boss. These configurations will make it harder
for authoratative figures to see when surveying the room thorugh the use of shrinking the size of the window and snake while the colors don't stand out.
